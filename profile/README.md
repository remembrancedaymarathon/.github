We're delighted to announce that our award winning Remembrance Day Marathon & Half Marathon event will be back again in 2024. Now in its 8th year, we hope you'll consider joining us for a very special run indeed and yet again, we've added a Half Marathon specific distance too, so that even more of you can get your hands on our famous Remembrance Day medals. The 2024 design is our best yet! 

Please note the entry fee is the same for both distances, and you'll be asked to marathon or half marathon as part of the entry process. The epic medal and awesome support are the same for everyone. 

In 2024, we're holding our annual Remembrance Day Marathon & Half Marathon on Sunday 10th November. 

This event is literally built around a unique ?race freeze' at 11.00am, where, at the sound of the horn blast, all runners stop to observe a 2 minute silence, resuming their race at exactly 11.02am when we should 3 blasts of the horns. Even if you're a fast half marathon runner and plan to have finished before 11am, why not stay around to pay your respects and absorb the unique atmosphere at 11.00am.
